	  Say Y here if you want to use CAN FD controller found on
	  Renesas R-Car SoCs. The driver puts the controller in CAN FD only
	  mode, which can interoperate with CAN2.0 nodes but does not support
	  dedicated CAN 2.0 mode.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called rcar_canfd.
