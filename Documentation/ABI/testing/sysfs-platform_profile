		This file can be monitored for changes by polling for POLLPRI,
		POLLPRI will be signalled on any changes, independent of those
		changes coming from a userspace write; or coming from another
		source such as e.g. a hotkey triggered profile change handled
		either directly by the embedded-controller or fully handled
		inside the kernel.
